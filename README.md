This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Twitter Hashtag feed

This app uses twitters API with a Create React App (CRA) to display 25 of the most recent posts from a hashtag of your choice.
Although this is a basic app it however does utilitize serveral Twitter API specific packages. It is also run on a simple node and express backend server
to serve up responses from our Twitter API and sends them to the client for display (This was also the way around the browsers CORS issue).

### Take aways

This project gave me a lot of insight to the Twitter API authentication and how its limitations behave when using it when building a Create React Applicaiton. This was without a doubt the most challenging aspect
of this project.

### Demo
Below is a brief video of the application in action.
