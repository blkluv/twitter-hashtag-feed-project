This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Twitter Hashtag feed

This app uses twitters API with a Create React App (CRA) to display 25 of the most recent posts from a hashtag of your choice.
Although this is a basic app it however does utilitize serveral Twitter API specific packages. It is also run on a simple node and express backend server
to serve up responses from our Twitter API and sends them to the client for display.

### Take aways

This project gave me a lot of insight to the Twitter API and how it limitations behave when using it when building a Create React Applicaiton. This was without a doubt the most challenging aspect
of this project.

### Demo
Below is a brief video of the application in action.
